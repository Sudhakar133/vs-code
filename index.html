            <h1>Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</h1>
            <p>
                HTTP1.1 <br>
            1.There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources. <br>
            2. It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages <br>
            3. It compresses data by itself.           </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                HTTP2 <br>
                1.It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests. <br>
                2.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages <br>
                3.	It uses HPACK for data compression.
            </p>

            <h1>objects and its internal representation in Javascript</h1>
            <p>1)Objects: <br>
                The following code assigns a simple value (Mercedes) to a variable named car: <br>

                
                var car = "Mercedes"; <br>
                Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. <br>
                
                The following code assigns many values (Mercedes, C-class, White and soo on) to a variable named Car: <br>
                var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”, Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5}; <br>
                The values are written as name:value pairs <br>
                Syntax: <br>

                var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN}; <br>
                 So, conclusion and definition for JS objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.</p>
